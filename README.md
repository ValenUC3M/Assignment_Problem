# Assignment_Problem
For this project we will have to assign to a boat layout different containers. This containers may have some restrictions as where you cna put them (there are three types of cells: 

X means floor cell so dont put anythinh here

S means standar so any type of container can go here

R means refrigerated so refrigerated containers only can go there)

For the part one we will use the python constraint libraries to create all the possible combinations of containers for a specific layout
